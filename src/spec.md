# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a daily routine tracking application with an AI assistant to help users manage and complete their daily tasks.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data model for storing routines (name, description, scheduled time, completion status, timestamp)
- Implement CRUD operations for routines (create, read, update, delete)
- Build frontend UI to display routine list with completion checkboxes
- Add form interface to create and edit routines
- Implement dashboard showing daily progress statistics (completion rate, streak tracking)
- Create AI assistant chat interface for routine management help
- Develop backend AI logic to analyze patterns and provide contextual suggestions
- Design with warm earth tones and clean typography for a calm, productive aesthetic

**User-visible outcome:** Users can create, view, edit, and check off daily routines, track their progress with statistics, and interact with an AI assistant that provides intelligent suggestions and reminders based on their routine patterns.
